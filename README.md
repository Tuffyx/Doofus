Doofus is a decent jump'n run by Prestige with colorful graphics, smooth sprites and surprisingly smooth scrolling even under Windows.

Also features some nice adlib tracks by Thomas Detert (666). Not too many interesting new ideas in terms of gameplay - besides the take-care-of-your-dog element. Give it a try if you like this kind of game. BTW: This PC conversion of the Amiga game by Sphinx from 1993 has become a different game! Different graphics, different music and different level design... Be sure to use the 55hz video-mode.
